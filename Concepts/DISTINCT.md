The ```DISTINCT``` keyword in SQL is used to return only distinct (different) values in a 'SELECT' statement. It eliminates duplicate records from the results.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ..., columnN
FROM table_name;
```

In the above syntax, you are asking the SQL engine to return distinct values from column1, column2, ..., columnN from the specified table.

Example

Let's say you have a table called 'Orders' as follows

| OrderID  | Customer    | 	Amount    |
| -------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1        | John        | 100        |          
| 2        | Jane        | 150        |
| 3        | Mary        | 100        |
| 4        | John        | 200        |
| 5        | Jane        | 100        |
| 6        | John        | 100        |
| 7        | Mary        | 150        |

If you run the following SQL statement
```sql
SELECT Customer FROM Orders;
```

It will return all the Customers including duplicates:
```
John
Jane
Mary
John
Jane
John
Mary
```

But if you use the DISTINCT keyword

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Customer FROM Orders;
```

It will return distinct values, eliminating duplicates:
```
John
Jane
Mary
```

Best Practices

Use DISTINCT judiciously: Distinct can be a very costly operation in terms of performance, as it requires sorting or hashing data, which could take a lot of time for large tables. Always ensure that you need to remove duplicates before using DISTINCT.

Choose Columns Wisely: Be careful while choosing the columns for the DISTINCT clause. If you choose all columns and one of them has a unique value (like an ID), then DISTINCT will return all rows.

Combine DISTINCT with other SQL clauses: You can use DISTINCT in conjunction with other SQL clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY etc. to get more specific results.

When Not to Use DISTINCT

There are a few scenarios when you should avoid using DISTINCT:

Large Datasets: If you're working with a large dataset, using DISTINCT might cause performance issues due to the extra processing power needed to eliminate duplicates.

Using DISTINCT on all columns: If you're using DISTINCT on all columns and one of them has a unique value (like an ID), then DISTINCT will return all rows, making it useless.

When duplicates are necessary: Sometimes, duplicates may be necessary for your analysis. For instance, when you're trying to count the number of orders placed by each customer, duplicates are important. In such cases, using DISTINCT would be incorrect.

When data grouping is more appropriate: In many cases, the GROUP BY clause can be used instead of DISTINCT for better performance, especially when you need aggregate information like SUM, COUNT, etc.

In summary, while DISTINCT can be a useful tool to eliminate duplicates, it should be used judiciously and appropriately considering the dataset size, the requirements of your query, and the specific columns that need to be distinct.

**You**: Show alternatives to using DISTINCT by example

**ChatGPT**: Sure, there are other ways to obtain distinct values in SQL without using the DISTINCT keyword. Here are a couple of common alternatives:

GROUP BY clause: This is often used as an alternative to DISTINCT when working with larger datasets or when you need to calculate some aggregate values. The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data.

Using the previous 'Orders' table, if we want to get distinct 'Customer' values, instead of using DISTINCT, we can use GROUP BY as follows:

```sql
SELECT Customer
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Customer;
```

This will return the same result as the DISTINCT query:
```John
Jane
Mary
```

Additionally, you can calculate aggregate values such as the total amount per customer:sql
```sql
SELECT Customer, SUM(Amount) as TotalAmount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Customer;
```

This will return:
```
John, 400
Jane, 250
Mary, 250
```

Using a subquery with ROW_NUMBER() function: This method can be useful when dealing with multiple columns. The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique row number to each row in the result set.

For instance, if we want to get unique rows based on the 'Customer' and 'Amount' columns, we could use a subquery with ROW_NUMBER() as follows

```sql
SELECT Customer, Amount
FROM (
  SELECT Customer, Amount, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Customer, Amount ORDER BY OrderID) as rn
  FROM Orders
) t
WHERE rn = 1;
```

This will return:

```
John, 100
John, 200
Jane, 150
Jane, 100
Mary, 100
Mary, 150
```

This method can be very powerful when dealing with more complex scenarios, but it's also more complex and could be less performant than using DISTINCT or GROUP BY, so use it carefully.

Remember, each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best one to use will often depend on the specifics of the problem you're trying to solve.
