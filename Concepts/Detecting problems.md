To ensure that an SQL query doesn't contain any errors, follow these steps:

Understand the Problem Statement: Before writing your SQL query, make sure you understand the problem statement thoroughly. What is the task you are trying to accomplish? Which tables are involved, and how are they related? What fields do you need to include in your result set?

Define the Structure: Sketch out the basic structure of your query. SQL queries follow a particular syntax:sql
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON condition
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
```

Not all parts are required in every query, but understanding this structure can help you build your query.

Write the Query: Start writing your query following the structure. Keep the following points in mind:Ensure all your parentheses match.SQL keywords are usually in uppercase for readability, but this is not strictly required.Make sure all your strings are properly quoted.Column names and table names need to be correct. If there are any special characters or spaces in table or column names, they need to be enclosed in backticks (`).

Check for Syntax Errors: Pay special attention to the SQL keywords you use, and their order. For example, the ```GROUP BY``` clause always comes before the ```HAVING``` clause, and they both come after the ```FROM``` clause. The ```SELECT``` clause always comes first. Mistaking the order of these elements can lead to syntax errors.

Validate Joins: When joining tables, ensure the correct fields are being used to join. Also, ensure that the right type of join (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN) is being used as per the requirement.

Check the Logic in WHERE and HAVING Clauses: The conditions in these clauses need to be logically sound and should not contradict each other.

Review GROUP BY and ORDER BY Clauses: If these clauses are used, ensure that the right columns are specified and in the correct order.

Ensure Correct Use of Aggregation Functions: If you're using aggregation functions like ```COUNT```, ```SUM```, ```AVG```, ```MIN```, ```MAX```, etc., make sure you're applying them to the right columns and in the right context.

Check Data Types: The data types in your SQL statements must match the data types in your database columns. For instance, donâ€™t compare a string to an integer or date.

Manually Execute the Query (If Possible): If you have access to the database, the best way to ensure your query is error-free is by running it. But in an exam scenario, you could simulate the execution in your mind or on paper, checking each step of the query against the given data.

Review, Review, Review: Finally, recheck everything. Errors often creep in when we're sure we've done everything correctly. Take a break if possible, then come back and review the query with fresh eyes.

Remember, the key to writing error-free SQL queries is practice. The more you write, the more familiar you become with the syntax and structure, and the fewer mistakes you'll make.
