****User****: Explain sql candidate keys with reference to example tables and sql


--------

In the context of relational databases, a candidate key is a set of one or more fields/columns that can identify a record uniquely in a table. This means that no two rows in the table can have the same values for all the fields that make up the candidate key. It's termed a 'candidate key' because it is a candidate for becoming the primary key of the table.

  
Here's an example to illustrate:


Let's assume we have a table ```Students```:Student_IDEmailFirst_NameLast_Name101john@abc.eduJohnDoe102emma@abc.eduEmmaWatson103robert@abc.eduRobertSmith

In the above table, both ```Student_ID``` and ```Email``` can be considered candidate keys because each of them can uniquely identify a record in the table. No two students have the same ```Student_ID``` or ```Email```.

Note that a candidate key can be a combination of columns. For example, if in a different context the ```Email``` column wasn't unique, but a combination of ```First_Name```, ```Last_Name```, and ```Email``` was unique, then those three columns together could form a composite candidate key.

In SQL, there's no specific command to set a candidate key because candidate keys aren't officially recognized or enforced by the database system. Instead, a database designer or administrator would likely choose one of the candidate keys to be the primary key, and that key would be enforced by the database system. The other keys may become alternate keys (other unique keys apart from primary key) if the designer or administrator decides to enforce their uniqueness.

For example, we could set ```Student_ID``` as the primary key and ```Email``` as an alternate key (assuming both were candidate keys) like so:sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    First_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Last_Name VARCHAR(255),
    UNIQUE (Email)
);
```

In the above SQL command, ```Student_ID``` is being set as the primary key (i.e., it is unique and must not be null), and ```Email``` is also being enforced as unique.
