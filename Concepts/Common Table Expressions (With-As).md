**You**: Explain SQL WITH/WITH AS queries and sub-queries thoroughly

------ 

The SQL ```WITH``` clause, also known as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), is used to create temporary result sets that can be referenced within another SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

The ```WITH``` clause can be very useful in simplifying complex queries, especially when sub-queries are needed. It allows you to name these sub-queries and refer to them later, making the SQL statement more readable and often more efficient.

Here is the basic syntax for a ```WITH``` clause:sql
```sql
WITH expression_name AS (
  SELECT ...
)
SELECT ... FROM expression_name ...
```

In the example above, ```expression_name``` is the name you choose for the sub-query. This name will be used in the main SQL statement.

Here's an example to make it clearer. Let's say we have a table ```employees``` and we want to select all departments that have more than 5 employees:sql
```sql
WITH dept_count AS (
  SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) as employee_count
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY dept_id
)
SELECT dept_id
FROM dept_count
WHERE employee_count > 5;
```

In this example, the ```WITH``` clause first creates a sub-query ```dept_count``` that calculates the number of employees in each department. Then, the main ```SELECT``` query fetches departments where the count of employees is more than 5.

Benefits of using the ```WITH``` clause:

Readability and Maintenance: The ```WITH``` clause allows for more readable and cleaner code, especially when sub-queries are involved. This can make maintenance easier.

Performance: In some cases, using a ```WITH``` clause can improve performance, because the results of the sub-query can be cached and used in multiple places within the main query.

Recursive Queries: In some database systems like PostgreSQL, the ```WITH``` clause can be used for recursive queries, which is when the query refers back to itself.

Important Notes:

CTEs (Common Table Expressions) are not stored as objects in the database and they only last for the duration of the query.

Also, not all SQL database systems support the ```WITH``` clause. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite all support the ```WITH``` clause. But it's always best to check the documentation for your specific SQL database system.

In some databases, the same result can be achieved by creating a view, but a ```WITH``` clause has the advantage that it's part of the same SQL statement and does not need to be created and managed separately.

Always try to avoid excessive nesting of sub-queries or over-complicating your queries. It can become difficult to read and maintain. Try breaking down complex queries into multiple simpler ones, if possible.
