**You**: Write a thorough explanation of SQL aggregate functions including example use cases and SQL

------

Aggregate functions in SQL are used to perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. They operate on a group of rows and calculate a single return value for every group. Here are the most common SQL aggregate functions:

COUNT(): This function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
```

This would return the total number of rows in the Employees table.

SUM(): This function returns the total sum of a numeric column.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;
```

This would return the total sum of the 'salary' column for all employees in the Employees table.

AVG(): This function returns the average value of a numeric column.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;
```

This would return the average 'salary' of all employees in the Employees table.

MIN(): This function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;
```

This would return the lowest 'salary' from the Employees table.

MAX(): This function returns the largest value of the selected column.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;
```

This would return the highest 'salary' from the Employees table.

GROUP BY: This statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result set by one or more columns. It's not an aggregate function itself, but it's frequently used in conjunction with them.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), department FROM Employees GROUP BY department;
```

This would return the number of employees in each department.

HAVING: This clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions. It's often used with the GROUP BY clause to filter the results.

Example:sql
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), department FROM Employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
```

This would return the departments that have more than 10 employees.

Remember, SQL aggregate functions ignore NULL values.

These are some of the most commonly used SQL aggregate functions. They provide ways of summarizing, grouping, and filtering data, making them a key aspect of many SQL queries.
