These are used to specify the rules concerning the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can be stored in a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the action, the action is aborted. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

Here are the most common SQL constraints:

NOT NULL Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
```

UNIQUE Constraint: Ensures that all values in a column are unique.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
```

PRIMARY KEY Constraint: Uniquely identifies each record in a database table. Primary keys must contain unique values. A primary key column cannot have NULL values. A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

FOREIGN KEY Constraint: Is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. A foreign key in a table points to a primary key in another table.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    EmployeeID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employees(ID)
);
```

CHECK Constraint: The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int CHECK (Age&gt;=18)
);
```

DEFAULT Constraint: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Unknown'
);
```

INDEX Constraint: Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly. Not officially a constraint but is used for optimizing database performance.

Example:sql
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee
ON Employees (ID);
```

Each of these constraints provides a way to enforce a specific rule on a table's data, which helps to maintain its integrity and reliability. It is important to choose the appropriate constraints when designing a database schema, as they can significantly affect both the functionality and performance of the database.
